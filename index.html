			<p>As well as being the tallest animal on earth (adult males can grow to around 5.5m), giraffe is a keystone species and plays an important role in their environment. 
				Giraffe is vital to keeping ecosystems in balance. They eat the browse that others cannot reach, which promotes growth of forage and opens up areas for themselves and other smaller browsers to make use of. 
				<br><br> 
				Moreover, giraffe is a highly social animal and lives in herds of 15-20 female giraffe and some young males. Male calves will leave their mothers and the herd from around 15 months and join bachelor herds of other young males. The female calves tend to stay with the same herd as their mothers but can leave after the age of around 18 months old, and most often stay in the same areas as the family herd they grew up in.
