## About the Project
This is the first project made during Udacity classroom on "Intro to Programming".

#### Project Overview
Title: _"Animal Trading Card"_

> GitHub: link -

> Package ZIP: link - 

This is a common flow for front-end web developers: typically provided with a design prototype that needs to be translated to a functional actual website.

The design prototype used in this project is inspired by trading cards. The task is to create the card, swapping out the fish with an animal of sudent's choice.

#### Design Prototype
This is the card example from which develop the project card.

Design Prototype (image)

#### Project Instructions
Feel free to customize information and style so long as you follow the following rules.
For inspiration, you can try playing around with _background-colors_ and _border-radius_. 
You can even add a _box-shadow_ around the card.

##### Customize _card.html_
1. Replace the placeholder image in _card.html_ with your favorite animal's image and information. Don't forget to change the _alt_ attribute of the image to the name of the animal chosen.

2. Modify _card.html_ to include attributes so that you can use _CSS selectors_ to style the specific elements required. Important to use meaningful names for CSS classes.

3. Link the _style.css_ in your _card.html_. Pay attention to not include any <style> elements or style attributes in the body of the _card.html_.

4. Replace current information with your animal's information:
    - Animal's name
    - Interesting facts about the animal
    - Lists of items for your animal's characteristics
    - Animal's brief description

##### Customize _style.css_
The _style.css_ should apply the following styles to match the design prototype:
- Use an image with a _width_ of 300 pixels. If the image is larger, you can set the image's width to 300 pixels in your CSS, but be aware that your image might end up squished or distorted
- The entire card's width should be fixed and it should include the spacing around the image (since image is 300 pixels wide, card should be 300 pixels + spacing on either side). The card should not expand with the browser window
- Italicized text for the animal's interesting facts
- Bolded labels for the animal's list items (only labels, not the entire list)
- No dots for the animal's list items
- Border around the animal's name, image and information (make sure you set the _border-style_, _border-width_ and _border-color_; it's possible to do it in one line)
- Spacing around the animal's name, image, the list of items and information (you will need to use the property [padding](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/padding))
